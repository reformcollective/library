# Infinite Side Scroll

Uses gsap Observable & Draggable, allows you scroll, or use the buttons, to progress through the content FOREVER.

If you want to add gradient faders, style the component and use &::before and &::after to create and position the faders. Don't forget to use position: relative for the parent element (probably this component)

Pass in ArrowButton as a styled button or UniversalLink as if it were the increment button. We'll flip it on the x axis to make it point the other way. to opt out of this, you can also pass in a second button as BackButton

If you want to add a gap between items, just add left margin to your items. alternatively, style the track and add a gap + left padding

## Custom Styling

InfiniteSideScroll has a className prop to allow you to add custom styling if needed. You can style the inner elements like so:

```js
const StyledSideScroll = styled(InfiniteSideScroll)`
	// custom styling for Wrapper

	& .track {
		// custom styling for Track
	}

	* .buttons {
		// custom styling for the wrapper around the buttons
	}
`
```
